Hobbies - Find Yourself a New Hobby Today!

We live in a world with access to so information and equipment we literally could spend our entire lives pursuing hobbies. Sadly, most of us spend our lives working. Striking a balance between work and play is essential to our health and well being.

I don't know about you, but I love hobbies. I might just spend more time collecting hobbies than I do actually doing my hobbies, so I started NotSoBoringLife.com. A site dedicated to hobbies. The best way to find a new hobby is to consult our List Of Hobbies page, where I've listed more than 200 different hobbies. Another great resource is the 50 Most Popular Hobbies. Either way you're bound to find something to suite your fancy.

Listed below are the different hobby categories. Under each category you'll find the different hobbies and a short guide with what to expect, where to start, and what kind of budget you can expect to invest in your new hobby. We're glad you stopped by and hope you're able to find a new hobby today!#^$

Have Your Figurines Appraised

" Is my item worth having appraised? "



Is a very good question, nobody wants to spend money to find out an item is worthless. This rarely happens, our records from 1996-2014 show that 97% of the figurines sent to us for appraisal have been worth more than $50.00. To date the highest valued item we have uncovered was valued at $80,000.00.



The piece pictured above was a unexpected surprise for one of our customers, it's a bronze after an original by the French sculptor Antoine Louis Barye (1796-1875). In today's market this piece cast by Susse Freres foundry after Barye's death would sell in $6,000 to $9,000 range. It had been sitting in the back of a china cabinet since the 1970's.



Why should you use our service?

On our forum you can have your appraisal ready for you within one working day, in some cases within two hours. We have been providing Appraisal information for Insurance, Estate, Tax & Probate purposes since 1959. Current Appraisal information for a wide range of antiques & collectible items can be hard to find, even on the internet. Have your appraisal emailed directly to you in 48 hours. Price guides already two years out of date when published and often give only a minimum of information. Specialized reference information is expensive and often difficult to find at your local library or bookstore. Professional appraisers fee's range from $ 75.00 to $400.00 per hour, and appraisers are booked weeks in advance.



How do we get our appraisal information?

We monitor all the major Auction Houses world wide for the most up to date sales results. We monitor Auction sales results from several Online Auctions daily and add these results weekly to our database. We subscribe to all the Major & Minor Antique & Collectible trade publications. Our Reference library is constantly growing, some of our books about Antique collecting & restoration date to the 1820's! We regularly participate in Roadshow type events, shows and auctions to maintain contact with those in the trade.

What will my appraisal look like?



We use the same research methods for our Online Appraisals as we do for our regular appraisals for Insurance, Tax or Estate purposes that follow the USPAP guidelines (Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice). Note that our appraisals are based on the images and information you send us, please read our disclaimer about Hypothetical Appraisals

Hot Item of the Week







The owner of this Royal Doulton figurine contacted us for an appraisal after they had inherited it. It's called "Charge of the Light Brigade", a model HN371 designed by Alan Maslankowski. They thought it might be worth about $350.00, but were shocked to find out this one was part of a limited edition by Royal Doulton, and routinely sells at auction for over $4500.00 USD.
